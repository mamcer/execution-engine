# ExecutionEngine

A .NET Library from 2013

In `original` branch you will find the original source code for this application. In `master` an upgraded, refactored version.

## Description

In different side projects I ended implementing and executing different little 'tasks', for example with ISO Finder. At that moment it sounds like a good idea to generalize it in some kind of reusable task manager engine. I invest some hours, was fun but it ended adding little real value.
